OJS 3.0 User Guide
=======

# This repository contained the built-in help for OJS 3.4.0 and prior. The in-app help has been retired in favour of the [PKP documentation hub](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca), so this repository is archived.

The OJS 3.0 User Guide provides context-sensitive help from within the application.
