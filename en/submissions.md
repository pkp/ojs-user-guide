### Searching in Large Lists

Each list of submissions has a search panel which will allow you to quickly find a submission. It will return any submissions where the title or author names match your search.

You can refine your search by including multiple terms separated with a space. For example, if you want to find a submission that you know included the word "Cyclomatic" in the title and included an author with the last name "Brown", you could search "cyclomatic brown" to bring up a match.

### Understanding Submission Status

Every submission listed will show the title, author(s) and it's current stage in the editorial workflow. In some cases you may see additional status indications. Over time, editors should learn to use these to stay on top of editorial tasks.

When your action is required to move a submission forward, you will see an alert message below the submission. For example, if you are the assigned editor for a submission that has reached the review stage, it will show you an alert message if you need to assign reviewers.

A submission may also display one or more status icons on the right. These indicate how many revision files, review assignments or discussions are in progress for this submission's current stage. At certain times, these icons may appear highlighted to signal that files or reviews are awaiting your attention.

### Activity Log & Notes

Editors and assistants can view a history of editorial actions that have been taken for each submission by clicking **Activity Log & Notes**. This is a good way to keep track of the latest activity that's happened on a submission, even if you're not directly assigned to it.

## <a name="my-queue"></a>My Queue

This tab will help you with your day-to-day activities by providing information about submissions currently assigned to you.
It will list all submissions you have authored. If you are a reviewer, copyeditor, subeditor or editor, it will also list any submissions you've been assigned to assist through the editorial workflow.

## <a name="unassigned"></a>Unassigned

Editors can view the **Unassigned** tab, which shows new submissions which need to have an editor or section editor assigned. As an editor, you should check this frequently to stay on top of new submissions if they are not automatically assigned to a section editor.

## <a name="active"></a>Active

Find any submission in the system that hasn't been published or declined. Only editorial and administrative users have access to this tab.

## <a name="archives"></a>Archives

Find submissions that have been published or declined. Any submissions no longer undergoing the editorial workflow can be found here.
